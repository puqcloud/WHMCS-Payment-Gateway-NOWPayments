### Payment Process Flow

1. **Page Load:** When the invoice page loads, the system displays a loading spinner while fetching available cryptocurrencies from NOWPayments API.
2. **Currency Loading:** The dropdown menu is populated with all supported cryptocurrencies (BTC, USDC, FUN, THETA, XRP, DOGE, ETH, and 200+ others).
3. **Default Selection:** The first available currency (typically BTC) is automatically selected and the system calculates the estimated amount.
4. **Rate Calculation:** When a customer selects a different cryptocurrency, the system automatically fetches the current exchange rate and updates the estimated amount in real-time.
5. **Amount Display:** The interface shows both the original invoice amount (e.g., "1.18 EUR") and the estimated cryptocurrency amount (e.g., "0.00001232 BTC").
6. **Payment Initiation:** When the customer clicks "Pay Now", they are redirected to the NOWPayments secure payment page to complete the transaction.
